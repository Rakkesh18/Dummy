### **1. Introduction**
This document provides a comprehensive guide for disaster recovery processes, focusing on the automated provisioning of resources using a YAML pipeline. It includes an overview of disaster recovery principles, details on how the pipeline operates, and the necessary access requirements to ensure seamless recovery during a disaster.

---

### **2. Disaster Recovery Overview**

#### **2.1 What is Disaster Recovery?**
Disaster Recovery (DR) refers to the strategies and procedures implemented to restore critical IT systems and infrastructure after a catastrophic event, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, or human errors. The goal is to ensure business continuity by quickly recovering essential operations and minimizing downtime.

#### **2.2 Importance of Disaster Recovery**
Having a robust disaster recovery plan is crucial for maintaining business continuity and protecting sensitive data. It ensures that in the event of a disaster, the organization can swiftly recover its IT environment, thereby avoiding significant financial losses and reputational damage.

---

### **3. Pipeline Overview**

#### **3.1 Pipeline Objectives**
The primary objective of the pipeline is to automate the provisioning of new resources in the event of a disaster. This includes deploying infrastructure components such as virtual machines, databases, networks, and other critical resources necessary for the application to function.

#### **3.2 How the Pipeline Works**
The pipeline is designed to trigger automatically upon detecting a disaster scenario, such as the failure of critical infrastructure. It works as follows:

- **Step 1:** Trigger Detection: The pipeline is triggered based on predefined conditions or manual activation.
- **Step 2:** Resource Deployment: The pipeline provisions the required infrastructure resources using predefined templates (e.g., ARM templates, Bicep scripts).
- **Step 3:** Configuration and Testing: The pipeline configures the deployed resources and runs validation tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
- **Step 4:** Notification: Once the deployment is complete, the pipeline sends notifications to relevant stakeholders.

#### **3.3 Pipeline Triggers and Conditions**
The pipeline can be triggered by various conditions, such as:
- Detection of a critical failure in the primary infrastructure.
- Manual initiation in response to a disaster.
- Scheduled tests or simulations to verify the DR plan.

### **4. Access Requirements**

#### **4.1 Required Roles and Permissions**
To execute the disaster recovery pipeline, specific roles and permissions are required. These include:

- **Pipeline Executor:** Requires Contributor or Owner permissions on the subscription/resource group to create and manage resources.
- **Security Team:** Requires Security Admin or equivalent roles to manage access and ensure compliance.
- **Monitoring Team:** Requires Reader or Monitoring Contributor roles to observe pipeline execution and resource health.

#### **4.2 Security Considerations**
Security is paramount during disaster recovery operations. The pipeline should be secured by:

- Implementing least privilege access.
- Encrypting sensitive data (e.g., passwords, keys) used in the pipeline.
- Ensuring that only authorized personnel can trigger or modify the pipeline.

#### **4.3 Access Control and Monitoring**
All access to the pipeline and deployed resources should be monitored and logged. This ensures transparency and accountability during disaster recovery operations.

---

### **5. Disaster Scenarios**

#### **5.1 Possible Disaster Events**
Identify possible disaster events such as:
- Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods)
- Cyberattacks (e.g., ransomware, DDoS)
- Infrastructure failures (e.g., data center outage)

#### **5.2 Recovery Strategies for Each Scenario**
Detail the specific recovery strategies for each identified disaster event, including which resources to provision and the order of operations.

---

### **6. Recovery Procedure**

#### **6.1 Step-by-Step Recovery Process**
Provide a detailed step-by-step guide on how to execute the disaster recovery process using the pipeline.

#### **6.2 Validation and Testing**
Explain how to validate that the recovery was successful, including tests for system functionality and performance.

#### **6.3 Post-Recovery Actions**
Detail the actions required after recovery, such as data synchronization, backup restoration, and business resumption.

---

### **7. Maintenance and Testing**

#### **7.1 Regular Testing of the Pipeline**
Outline the schedule for regular testing of the disaster recovery pipeline to ensure it is functioning as expected.

#### **7.2 Updating the Runbook**
Include guidelines on how and when to update the runbook, ensuring it remains current with any changes in the infrastructure or recovery processes.

---

### **8. Appendices**

#### **8.1 Glossary**
Include definitions of technical terms and acronyms used in the document.

#### **8.2 References**
List any references, such as documentation, articles, or external resources, that support the runbook content.

#### **8.3 Contact Information**
Provide contact details for key personnel responsible for disaster recovery, including the IT department, security team, and management.
